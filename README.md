### Find two numbers for k

Programm finds two numbers that add up to k. 
The algorithm is the summation of each number with subsequent ones from the array, that is, the first is added to the second, third, and so on, the second is added to the third, fourth, and so on. The last element from the array no longer needs to be summed in any way
